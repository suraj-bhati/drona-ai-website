Sure! Let's break down the script into manageable steps, ensuring we can build and test each step thoroughly before moving on to the next one. Here's the plan, divided into clear steps:

---

### **Step 1: Setup and Environment Preparation**
**Goal**: Set up the environment and ensure the necessary libraries and tools are ready for the script.

#### Tasks:
1. Install Python libraries (`selenium`, `pandas` for CSV handling, etc.).
2. Download and set up ChromeDriver.
3. Verify that the script runs on your machine with basic browser automation.

---

### **Step 2: Open Tindie and Login**
**Goal**: Open the Tindie discussion page and log in successfully.

#### Tasks:
1. Open the Tindie login page: `https://discuss.tindie.com/`.
2. Locate the username and password fields.
3. Fill in login credentials and submit.
4. Add basic logging for success: "Login successful, press Enter to continue."

---

### **Step 3: Navigate to the Messages Page**
**Goal**: Navigate to the message inbox after logging in.

#### Tasks:
1. After login, navigate to: `https://discuss.tindie.com/u/SpartanJet/messages`.
2. Ensure the page loads correctly and display a log message: "Navigated to the messages page."

---

### **Step 4: Locate and Click "New Message" Button**
**Goal**: Find the "New Message" button and click it to open the message creation popup.

#### Tasks:
1. Locate the "New Message" button on the page.
2. Click the button and wait for the popup to load.
3. Ensure that the popup appears by checking for the presence of the popup fields.
4. Add a log message: "Popup opened for new message."

---

### **Step 5: Fill in the "Subject" and "Body" Fields with Rotating Data**
**Goal**: Fill in the "Subject" and "Body" fields with rotating content from predefined lists.

#### Tasks:
1. Create a list of 10 subjects and 10 body options.
2. Rotate through these lists so that each message has a different subject and body.
3. Enter the subject and body content into the corresponding fields in the popup.
4. Add logging to verify the content has been entered correctly.

---

### **Step 6: Read Usernames from CSV and Fill the "User" Field**
**Goal**: Read usernames from the `user.csv` file and populate the "User" field in batches of 3 users at a time.

#### Tasks:
1. Use the `csv` module (or `pandas`) to load user data from the `user.csv` file.
2. Create batches of 3 users per message.
3. Fill the "User" field with the 3 usernames in each batch.

---

### **Step 7: Click "Send Message"**
**Goal**: Click the "Send Message" button and submit the message.

#### Tasks:
1. Locate the "Send Message" button in the popup.
2. Click the button to send the message.
3. Add logging to confirm the action: "Message sent, waiting for confirmation."

---

### **Step 8: Handle Success and Failure Scenarios**
**Goal**: Validate the success or failure of the message and take appropriate actions.

#### Tasks:
1. **Success Case**: Check if the URL redirects to a page with a pattern like `https://discuss.tindie.com/t/merry-christmas/491028`. If successful, save the URL to `discuss.csv`.
2. **Failure Case**: If the error popup appears (e.g., "Body is too similar"), log the error and retry with a new subject/body combination.
3. Add retry logic to ensure the message is sent despite failures.

---

### **Step 9: Progress Tracking and Saving State**
**Goal**: Save progress so the script can resume where it left off if interrupted.

#### Tasks:
1. Save the last user, subject, and body index to a `progress.json` file.
2. Implement logic to load progress from `progress.json` and resume sending messages from the last successful state.
3. Add logging to indicate progress saving and loading.

---

### **Step 10: Loop Through and Send Messages in Batches**
**Goal**: Automate the entire message sending process in batches and ensure the script handles multiple messages with proper rotation.

#### Tasks:
1. Loop through users in batches of 3 and rotate subjects and bodies.
2. Continue sending messages until all users are processed.
3. Log the progress and handle any issues (e.g., timeouts, errors).

---

### **Step 11: Logging and Debugging**
**Goal**: Implement detailed logging for monitoring and debugging.

#### Tasks:
1. Add log messages for each significant action (e.g., login, navigation, sending message, success/failure).
2. Include timestamps for easy tracking of when each action occurs.
3. Write logs to a file for persistent tracking.

---

### **Step 12: Final Testing and Improvements**
**Goal**: Test the script as a whole, fix bugs, and make improvements.

#### Tasks:
1. Run the entire script end-to-end and observe the results.
2. Handle any errors that arise during testing.
3. Optimize for performance and reliability.

### Let's Start with **Step 1**: **Setup and Environment Preparation**

We'll begin by ensuring the environment is properly set up.

#### Tasks:
1. Install `selenium`:
   ```bash
   pip install selenium
   ```
2. Install `pandas` (for CSV handling, if required):
   ```bash
   pip install pandas
   ```

3. Download the correct version of ChromeDriver based on your browser version:
